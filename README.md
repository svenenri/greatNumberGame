# greatNumberGame
Web application that allows the user to input a number and returns wither the number is too high, too low, or the correct number

Languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- Python

Frameworks:
- Flask (Python microframework)

Upcoming Improvements:
- Add check for if the users entry is:
  - a number and not a letter or other character
  - between 1 and 100
  - (Will flash a messege with instructions on what a proper entry is if either or both tests fail)
